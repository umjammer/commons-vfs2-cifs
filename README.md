# commons-vfs2-cifs

[Commons VFS](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/) provides a single API for accessing various different file systems. It presents a uniform view of the files from various different sources.

Project "commons-vfs2-cifs" is a SMB/CIFS provider for Commons VFS.

âš  this project uses **"cifs"** as the vsf2 protocol name instead of "smb"

## Requirements

Project "commons-vfs2-cifs" requires:
* [jcifs-ng library](https://github.com/AgNO3/jcifs-ng)
* Java 17

## Install

* [maven](https://jitpack.io/#umjammer/commons-vfs2-cifs)

## Example

```java
// Retrieve file system manager
FileSystemManager fileManager = VFS.getManager();

// Configure authenticator
FileSystemOptions fileSystemOptions = new FileSystemOptions();
StaticUserAuthenticator userAuthenticator =
    new StaticUserAuthenticator(domain, login, password);

DefaultFileSystemConfigBuilder.getInstance()
    .setUserAuthenticator(fileSystemOptions, userAuthenticator);

// Resolve file object file from virtual file system
String uri = "cifs://fs/Documents";
FileObject fileObject = fileManager.resolveFile(uri, fileSystemOptions);
```

## Known Issues

To date, JCIFS has always tried NetBIOS broadcast lookups in favor of DNS which frequently resulted in 6 seconds
delay  if the jcifs.resolveOrder property was not adjusted. This behavior has been changed to try  DNS before NetBIOS
broadcast lookups which should result in much less frequent delays when using default settings. To restore the old
behavior, simply set **jcifs.resolveOrder=LMHOSTS,BCAST,DNS**.
